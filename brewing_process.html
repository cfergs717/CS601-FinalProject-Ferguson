            <h2>Notes about the video</h2>
            <p>This video does an excellent job of outlining the entire brewing process, but I thought it would be educational
                to point out some key differences between what's described in the video (traditional, German methods) and what
                occurs today in the U.S.
            </p>

            <!-- The video is oriented more towards German methods of brewing, so I drew some contrasting
                    points to what happens in the American brewing industry. -->
            <ul>
                <li>Most American breweries don't use Kieselguhr (Diatomaceous Earth). It's an old filtration method used
                    by the Germans, and on top of its difficulty of use, it's carcinogenic to breathe in the powder (weirdly,
                    it's totally fine to ingest/drink once in the beer)
                </li>
                <li>LOTS of other adjuncts are used today in the U.S., such as fruits, nuts, herbs, etc...
                    the Germans hate that we do this (LOL).</li>
                <li>Most breweries are not large enough for the brewer to be sitting at a desk behind a computer screen. Brewers
                    are basically glorified janitors.
                </li>
                <li>Multi-step mashing (as described in the video) is more common in German brewing. Americans tend to
                    use "Single Infusion" mashing, where you mash in at one temperature and let it rest.
                </li>
                <li>I could name plenty more, but you're probably bored by now (:</li>
