            <h2>Origins of Brewing</h2>
            <p class="wordwrap"> The oldest, chemically confirmed source of beer was found in pottery dating back to 
                Iran approximately 7000 years ago (Source 1 below)! In China, residue on pottery dating from around 
                5,000 years ago shows beer was brewed using barley and other grains (Source 2 below). Today, barley 
                is still the primary grain used in brewing.

            <h2>More Fun History Surrounding Beer</h2>
            <p class="wordwrap">By the 19th century, London had grown to be a large, overpopulated city with poor sanitary conditions. 
                The city was gripped with a series of cholera outbreaks. The first wave of the disease occurred in 1831 
                and killed thousands of people. Another outbreak occurred in 1849 and between the two events, more than 
                14,000 people died. So how does this relate to beer??
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/london_cholera_beer.jpg" alt="John Snow discovered water as the cause of Cholera." class="responsive" 
                width="600" height="314">
                <figcaption>John Snow is credited with discovering water to be the true cause of cholera, 
                    not air (as previously thought).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="wordwrap">In a brewery on nearby Poland Street, almost ALL of the 535 workers were not contracting Cholera, even though 
                the surrounding citizens were all sick. How could this be? ... Well, beer itself is too harsh of an environment 
                for Cholera to survive - too much alcohol, too low of a pH, and hops contain antibacterial qualities. At the time, 
                brewery workers enjoyed beer for free and as their primary (usually only) source of hydration...don't worry, most 
                beers at the time were less than 4% ABV. However, it was this connection to beer that caused John Snow to discover 
                that Cholera was, in fact, a water-borne illness. So if you ask me, beer saves lives. Fun, right? (:
