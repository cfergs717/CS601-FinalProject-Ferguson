***CS601 - Final Project - Colin Ferguson***

Hello, and welcome to my personal portfolio! Due to my lack of professional development experience, I felt it was more relevant to make this website about the industry I've been working in since undergrad. - Brewing!

As a young, broke college student, I grew tired of only being able to afford low-quality beer. Plus, I lived with six other men ... let's just say that beer didn't last long in the house, especially if it was anything of a decent quality. Therefore, I took up homebrewing in order to have access to higher quality beverages for a fraction of the cost!

Ever since then, I was hooked. Right after graduating from the University of Pittsburgh, I enrolled in brewing school. For the last nine years, I've been brewing professionally, and finally, I'll be opening a place of my own soon! My goal is to eventually utilize the skills I've learned in this class to build a professional, business-ready website for my own brewery. (:


**Details about the site**

THIS SITE IS HOSTED ON GLITCH, SO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW YOU TRY TO DOWNLOAD THESE FILES. I RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THE .tgz FILE AND GOING FROM THERE!

While this website only consists of six total pages, there's a lot of CSS and JS interacting behind the scenes. 

I used Vue on my Home page to include similar functionality as what we built in HW #6, but I added image captions changing with the pictures as well. On each page, some JS is used for generating the current data in the Navigation window and generating random (Beer) quotes in the footer. On the Recipe page, I employed JS with the fetch functionality to dynamically populate a table with recipe information. I hope to include Vue on this page as well so that an arrow button can be pushed to scrolls through multiple recipes.

CSS is utilized throughout the entire website. My favorite piece is the header on each page - words are independently colored every 4 seconds to simulate a basic animation. All images and text are formatted and centered while trying to keep accessibility and responsiveness in mind. For example, when the page reaches a width of 750 pixels or less, the background and text colors are changed into something that is more easily readable. Additionally, while I didn't have the chance to employ something like FlexBox or Grid, I believe all components/containers stay relatively organized when the page is enlarged or shrank.

**Errors/Warnings**

Excluding index.html which includes Vue code, all HTML and CSS pages pass validation without any errors.

**Comments**

While this isn't anything close to a production website, I believe this was a good first step into the world of web development. I hope to eventually develop the skills to employ a much cleaner, more professional looking website for my brewery one day.

**THANK YOU**

Cheers,
Colin Ferguson
