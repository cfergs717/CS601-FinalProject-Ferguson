            <h2>My Brewing Career</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to my brewing career page! Unlike most of you, I have not spent 
                my adult career in the technology field. Instead, right after graduating from the University of Pittsburgh
                with a Bachelors in Computer Science, I decided to pursue my favorite hobby (homebrewing) as a career.
                I immediately enrolled in the Siebel Institute of Technology, where I spent six months in Chicago and six
                months in Munich, Germany studying brewing science. Upon graduation, I started working for Ithaca Beer Co. 
                in Ithaca, NY, and a few years later I began working for Other Half Brewing approximately 30 minutes south
                of Rochester, NY. Currently, I'm working to open my own brewery in the summer of 2023, and I'm hoping this class
                will be a good resource for building our company website!
